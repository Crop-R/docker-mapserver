# Docker image for mapserver 7.2

Here is a sample Dockerfile for using it:
```
FROM camptocamp/mapserver

COPY *.map /etc/mapserver/
COPY *.sh *.env /docker-entrypoint.d/
```

The main mapfile should be `/etc/mapserver/mapserver.map`.

Or you can use the image as is and mount volumes to customize it.

Only tags for minor releases exist, not tag for bug fixes.

If the container is run as root, apache listens on port 80. If it is run as
another user, it listens on port 8080.

## Tunings

All the bash snipets in /docker-entrypoint.d ending with `.env` will
be sourced.

All the executable files in /docker-entrypoint.d ending with `.sh` will
be executed by the default entrypoint.

All the files ending with `.tmpl` in /etc/mapserver and /etc/apache2 (can be
changed by defining CONFD_DIRS in one of the sourced files) will go though
confd with the `env` backend. The TOML files are created automagically to
create a file at the same location, with just the `.tmpl` extension removed.

You can use the following environment variables (when starting the container)
to tune it:
* MS_DEBUGLEVEL: The debug level 0=off 5=verbose
* MS_ERRORFILE: If you want the debug to something other than STDOUT
* MAX_REQUESTS_PER_PROCESS: To work around memory leaks (defaults to 1000)

## Project version

The version 7.2.x will be in the [branch 7.2](https://github.com/camptocamp/docker-mapserver/tree/7.2).
